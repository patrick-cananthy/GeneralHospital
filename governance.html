                <img src="img/Gallery/boardmeeting.jpg"class="p-3"width="500px" style="float: right;" alt="Our hospital" /> <p style="text-align: justify; ">            
            With the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), hospital attendance surged dramatically, with outpatient visits increasing from 180,914 in 2007 to 207,329 in 2008. However, the hospital’s ability to handle the increased
                demand has been strained by several challenges. These include insufficient staffing, inadequate accommodation for employees, poor infrastructure with structural defects, and a lack of security personnel. Additionally, the hospital’s mortuary
                was shut down due to its deteriorated condition, and the absence of a pathologist has complicated autopsy procedures. Financially, NHIS reimbursement delays and the use of district-level tariffs for claims further strain the hospital’s
                resources. <br> Despite these challenges, Tema General Hospital continues to evolve to meet the healthcare demands of its patients. It currently operates with twelve wards, a bed capacity of 439, and provides 24-hour specialist and general
                services to both outpatients and inpatients. The hospital offers a wide range of services, including <span class="fw-bold"> Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Reproductive and Child Health Care/Family Planning, and Emergency
                Services </span>. Additionally, it runs specialized clinics such as  <span class="fw-bold">Eye Care, Dental, Diabetic Clinic, Intensive Care, Dermatology, ENT, Chest, Hypertensive, and Anesthetic Clinics, as well as the ART/PMTCT Unit. </span> <br> Support services such as
                <span class="fw-bold">Laboratory/Blood Bank, Radiology/Ultrasound, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, and ECG, along with facilities including a Staff Rest Room, Catering, Mortuary, Laundry/CSSD, Stores and Supplies, Estate, Social Welfare, Mental Health Unit, and Wellness
                Centre, </span> ensure comprehensive care delivery.</p>
